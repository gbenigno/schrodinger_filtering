The data in the 'raw' directory are from the EEG struct provided at https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/eeglab/fmribplugin/#tutorial. Data are given as individual mat files representing individual electrode channel timeseries, numbered accordingly. The data in the 'aas' directory are the raw data processed using the FACET (10.1186/1471-2202-14-138) toolbox (https://github.com/hansiglaser/facet), using the script CleanEx1.m from the FACET repo, but excluding PCA, lowpass filtering, and adaptive noise cancellation.

Sampling rate 2048 Hz.

Mains frequency 50 Hz.

The trigs vector contains the trigger indices (samples) with one entry appended to represent the end of the last slice epoch. The indices are shifted to the left slightly.
